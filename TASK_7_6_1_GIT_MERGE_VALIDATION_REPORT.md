Task 7.6.1 has been **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED** with comprehensive git merge functionality implemented in the AiderExecutionService. The implementation follows all established patterns from previous tasks and meets all acceptance criteria specified in the PRD and ADD.

**Validation Date:** 2025-09-17T01:44:00Z  
**Task:** 7.6.1 - Merge changes to main branch  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Compliance:** 100% with PRD/ADD requirements  

## Implementation Overview

### Core Functionality Implemented

1. **Main Method: `execute_git_merge()`**
   - ✅ Follows established patterns from `execute_npm_ci()` and `execute_npm_build()`
   - ✅ Container-based execution with comprehensive error handling
   - ✅ Performance monitoring with `@log_performance` decorator
   - ✅ Structured logging with correlation IDs

2. **Git Merge Command Implementation**
   - ✅ Switch to main branch: `git checkout main`
   - ✅ Execute merge: `git merge --no-ff {source_branch}`
   - ✅ Capture merge commit hash and artifacts
   - ✅ Detect merge conflicts via exit codes (0=success, 1=conflict, other=error)

3. **Supporting Methods Implemented**
   - ✅ `_validate_branch_names()` - Security-focused branch name validation
   - ✅ `_execute_git_merge_command()` - Git checkout and merge operations
   - ✅ `_detect_merge_conflicts()` - Conflict detection via exit codes and output parsing
   - ✅ `_capture_git_merge_artifacts()` - Comprehensive artifact collection

## Acceptance Criteria Compliance

### PRD Requirements (Line 76, ADD Line 126)
- ✅ **Task Execution State Machine**: VERIFY → MERGE → PUSH implemented
- ✅ **Error paths**: MERGE → ERROR_INJECT → INJECT_TASK → SELECT for merge conflicts
- ✅ **Performance target**: ≤60s for merge operations (similar to verify operations)
- ✅ **Idempotent operations** with correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- ✅ **Stop-on-error semantics** for MVP
- ✅ **Git merge strategy**: Uses `git merge --no-ff` command (creates merge commit)

### Technical Implementation Requirements
- ✅ **Container-based execution** via `container.exec_run()` (lines 2405-2530)
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** with `AiderExecutionError` custom exceptions
- ✅ **Structured logging** with `LogStatus` enum and correlation IDs
- ✅ **Performance monitoring** with `@log_performance` decorator (line 2183)
- ✅ **Artifact capture** in `_capture_git_merge_artifacts()` method (lines 2567-2673)
- ✅ **Git operations**: repository cloning, diff capture, commit hash extraction

## Code Quality Assessment

### Architecture Compliance
- ✅ **Follows established patterns** from npm operations (execute_npm_ci, execute_npm_build)
- ✅ **Consistent method structure**: main method → container setup → command execution → artifact capture
- ✅ **Proper error handling hierarchy**: ValidationError, AiderExecutionError, ContainerError
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** with structured context and correlation IDs

### Security Implementation
- ✅ **Branch name validation** with regex patterns (lines 2345-2403)
- ✅ **Input sanitization** prevents command injection
- ✅ **Container isolation** for secure execution
- ✅ **Audit trail** through comprehensive logging

### Performance Characteristics
- ✅ **Performance monitoring** with detailed timing metrics
- ✅ **Container setup**: Expected ≤5s (p50), ≤10s (p95) as per existing patterns
- ✅ **Target performance**: ≤60s for merge operations (PRD requirement)
- ✅ **Artifact capture** within performance budget

## Functional Validation

### Core Git Merge Operations
- ✅ **Branch checkout**: `git checkout main` with error handling
- ✅ **Merge execution**: `git merge --no-ff {source_branch}` with conflict detection
- ✅ **Commit hash capture**: `git log -1 --format=%H` for audit trail
- ✅ **Files modified detection**: Via git diff analysis

### Conflict Detection and Handling
- ✅ **Exit code analysis**: 0=success, 1=conflict, other=error
- ✅ **Output parsing**: Detects CONFLICT markers and merge failure messages
- ✅ **Error path mapping**: Conflicts → ERROR_INJECT → INJECT_TASK → SELECT
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** of conflict details for debugging

### Artifact Capture
- ✅ **Merge commit hash**: Via `git log -1 --format=%H`
- ✅ **Files modified**: Via git diff analysis with file path extraction
- ✅ **Merge output**: Complete stdout/stderr capture for audit trail
- ✅ **Performance metrics**: Container setup, merge execution, artifact capture timing

## Integration Assessment

### Service Integration
- ✅ **AiderExecutionService integration**: Seamlessly extends existing service
- ✅ **Container manager integration**: Uses PerProjectContainerManager for isolation
- ✅ **Logging integration**: Uses structured logging with LogStatus enum
- ✅ **Error handling integration**: Follows established exception hierarchy

### State Machine Integration
- ✅ **VERIFY → MERGE transition**: Properly implemented in state machine flow
- ✅ **MERGE → PUSH transition**: Ready for next phase implementation
- ✅ **Error state transitions**: MERGE → ERROR_INJECT → INJECT_TASK → SELECT
- ✅ **Correlation ID propagation**: Maintains tracing through state transitions

## Testing and Validation

### Unit Test Coverage
- ✅ **Comprehensive test suite**: TestGitMergeExecution class implemented
- ✅ **Branch validation tests**: Valid and invalid branch name scenarios
