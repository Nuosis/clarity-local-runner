$ARGUMENTS

## Process

1. **Gather Project Information**
   - Review original project charter and PRD
   - Analyze final implementation vs initial plans
   - Collect metrics and performance data
   - Document timeline and milestones

2. **Identify Key Story Elements**
   - **Challenge**: What problem was being solved?
   - **Solution**: How was it approached and implemented?
   - **Results**: What outcomes were achieved?
   - **Lessons**: What was learned in the process?

3. **Interview Stakeholders** (if applicable)
   - Development team insights
   - User feedback and testimonials
   - Business impact assessment
   - Technical achievements

4. **Structure the Narrative**
   - Executive summary
   - Background and context
   - Technical approach
   - Implementation journey
   - Results and impact
   - Future implications
