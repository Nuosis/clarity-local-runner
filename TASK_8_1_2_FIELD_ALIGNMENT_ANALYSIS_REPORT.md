## Detailed Analysis

### 1. StatusProjection Schema Fields (11 fields)

Based on analysis of [`app/schemas/status_projection_schema.py`](app/schemas/status_projection_schema.py):

```python
StatusProjection fields:
- execution_id: str (required)

- started_at: Optional[datetime]
- updated_at: Optional[datetime]
```

### 2. API Response Schema Fields (11 fields)

Based on analysis of [`app/schemas/devteam_automation_schema.py`](app/schemas/devteam_automation_schema.py):

```python
DevTeamAutomationStatusResponse fields:
- status: str (required)
- progress: float (required, 0.0-100.0)
- current_task: Optional[str]
- totals: Dict[str, int] (required)
- execution_id: str (required)

- customer_id: Optional[str]
- branch: Optional[str]
- artifacts: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
- started_at: Optional[str]
- updated_at: Optional[str]
```

### 3. Field Mapping Implementation Analysis

The field mapping in [`app/api/v1/endpoints/devteam_automation.py`](app/api/v1/endpoints/devteam_automation.py) (lines 802-823) demonstrates **complete and accurate mapping**:

#### ✅ Direct Field Mappings (7 fields)
```python
# Perfect 1:1 mappings
status=status_projection.status.value,           # Enum to string conversion
progress=status_projection.progress,             # Direct mapping
current_task=status_projection.current_task,     # Direct mapping
execution_id=status_projection.execution_id,     # Direct mapping
project_id=status_projection.project_id,         # Direct mapping
customer_id=status_projection.customer_id,       # Direct mapping
branch=status_projection.branch,                 # Direct mapping
```

#### ✅ Nested Object Mappings (2 fields)
```python
# TaskTotals nested mapping
totals={
    "completed": status_projection.totals.completed,
    "total": status_projection.totals.total
},

# ExecutionArtifacts nested mapping
artifacts={
    "repo_path": status_projection.artifacts.repo_path,
    "branch": status_projection.artifacts.branch,
    "logs": status_projection.artifacts.logs,
    "files_modified": status_projection.artifacts.files_modified
} if status_projection.artifacts else None,
```

#### ✅ Timestamp Transformations (2 fields)
```python
# Proper datetime to ISO string conversion
started_at=status_projection.started_at.isoformat() if status_projection.started_at else None,
updated_at=status_projection.updated_at.isoformat() if status_projection.updated_at else None
```

### 4. Structured Logging Consistency Analysis

#### API Endpoint Logging Fields
From [`app/api/v1/endpoints/devteam_automation.py`](app/api/v1/endpoints/devteam_automation.py):
```python
Common logging fields:
- correlation_id
- execution_id
- project_id
- operation
- status (LogStatus)
- duration_ms
- performance_target_met
- response_status
```

#### Worker Task Logging Fields
From [`app/worker/tasks.py`](app/worker/tasks.py):
```python
Common logging fields:
- correlation_id
- execution_id
- project_id
- task_id
- operation
- status
- duration_ms
```

#### ✅ Logging Consistency Score: 85.7%
- **Common fields:** 6/7 fields are consistent
- **CustomJSONEncoder:** Properly implemented for Pydantic model serialization
- **Structured patterns:** Consistent across components

### 5. Performance Optimization Analysis

The implementation includes several performance optimizations:

#### ✅ Response Time Monitoring
```python
# Performance tracking in all endpoints
start_time = time.time()
duration_ms = (time.time() - start_time) * 1000
performance_target_met = duration_ms <= 200
```

#### ✅ Efficient Field Mapping
- Direct field access without unnecessary transformations
- Conditional nested object creation
- Optimized datetime conversions

#### ✅ Database Query Optimization
- Single query for status projection retrieval
- Indexed lookups by project_id and execution_id
- Efficient task_context transformation
