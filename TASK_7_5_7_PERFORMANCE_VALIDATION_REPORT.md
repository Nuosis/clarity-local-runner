## Performance Test Results

### Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 5
- **Successful Tests**: 4
- **Failed Tests**: 1
- **Success Rate**: 80.0%

### Performance Metrics
- **Performance Threshold**: 60000ms (60s)
- **Compliant Tests**: 5/5
- **Compliance Rate**: 100.0%
- **Average Duration**: 15925.3ms
- **Maximum Duration**: 35512.1ms

## PRD Compliance Status

- **verify_operations_60s**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- **container_bootstrap_5s_p50**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- **container_bootstrap_10s_p95**: ✅ COMPLIANT
- **max_2_attempts**: ✅ COMPLIANT

## Test Scenarios Validated

1. **Single Operation Success (First Attempt)**: Validates performance when operations succeed immediately
2. **Retry Operation Success (Second Attempt)**: Validates performance with one retry attempt
3. **Maximum Retry Performance (Both Attempts Fail)**: Validates worst-case performance scenario
4. **Container Setup Performance**: Validates container bootstrap times against PRD requirements
5. **Edge Case Performance**: Validates performance under challenging conditions

## Recommendations

Based on the validation results, the retry functionality demonstrates compliance with PRD performance requirements.
