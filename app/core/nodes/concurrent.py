class ConcurrentNode(Node, ABC):
    """
    Base class for nodes that execute other nodes concurrently using asyncio.

    This class provides a method to execute a list of nodes concurrently on a single thread,
    using asyncio.gather. This ensures that I/O-bound operations can proceed in parallel
    without blocking the main thread or event loop.

    When to use:
    - Use ConcurrentNode when running the workflow in the main application, where the event loop is active
      (for example, in a FastAPI app or a CLI tool).
    - It is also perfectly fine to use ConcurrentNode within Celery tasks â€” Celery runs the task in a worker process,
      and asyncio code will execute efficiently in that context.
    - It is especially suited for workflows that consist mostly of async I/O operations (e.g. network calls, database access).
    - It will not block other processes.

    Subclasses must implement the `process` method to define the specific logic of the concurrent node.
