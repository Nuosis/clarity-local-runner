Performance Validation Test for Task 6.2.2: Send execution-log frames with ≤500ms latency

This test validates that the ExecutionLogService can send execution-log frames
to WebSocket connections within the required ≤500ms latency target.

Test Coverage:
- ExecutionLogService instantiation and basic functionality
- WebSocket broadcasting performance validation
- Latency measurement and verification
- Integration with structured logging system
- Error handling and graceful degradation

Performance Requirements:
- ≤500ms WebSocket latency for execution-log frames
- Consistent performance across multiple log entries
- Proper integration with existing WebSocket infrastructure
