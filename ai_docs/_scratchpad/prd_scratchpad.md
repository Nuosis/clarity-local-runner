# PRD Scratchpad - DevTeam Runner Service

## Context Review
- Project Charter: ✅ Reviewed - MVP READY
- Implementation Guide: ✅ Reviewed - Comprehensive technical specs
- Scope: Backend microservice for autonomous development task execution

## Key Context Points
- **Core Function**: SELECT→PREP→IMPLEMENT→VERIFY pipeline
- **Technology**: Python/FastAPI, Docker containerized
- **Integration**: Git repos, Aider tool, WebSocket communication
- **Phase 1**: Stop-on-error semantics, single tool integration
- **Performance**: ≤2s prep, ≤30s implement, ≤60s verify
- **Target**: ≥80% autonomous completion rate

## Personas Identified from Charter/Guide
1. **Frontend Developer** - Primary user via DevTeam interface
2. **Project Manager** - Monitoring multiple customer projects  
3. **Backend Developer** - Service maintenance and integration

## Primary Journeys (from implementation guide)
1. **Task Execution Journey**: Health check → Select task → Prep → Implement → Verify
2. **Real-time Monitoring Journey**: Connect WebSocket → Receive updates/logs
3. **Multi-customer Management Journey**: Parallel execution across projects

## Requirements Categories
- **Functional**: API endpoints, task selection, Git ops, tool integration
- **Non-functional**: Performance SLAs, reliability, security, scalability
- **Data**: Task definitions, execution state, artifacts, logs

## PRD Generation Complete ✅

### Delivered Components
- **Product Overview**: Clear value proposition and business outcome
- **3 Personas**: Frontend Developer (primary), Project Manager, Backend Developer
- **3 Primary Journeys**:
  1. Autonomous Task Execution (SELECT→PREP→IMPLEMENT→VERIFY)
  2. Real-time Progress Monitoring (WebSocket streaming)
  3. Multi-Customer Project Management (parallel execution)
- **Functional Requirements**: Organized by journey with MoSCoW prioritization
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, reliability, security targets
- **5 Core Data Objects**: Task Definition, Execution State, Operation Artifact, WebSocket Event, Verification Result
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Given/When/Then format for each journey
- **API Summary**: All endpoints from implementation guide
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable targets aligned with charter
- **Constraints & Assumptions**: Technical and business limitations

### Key Highlights
- ≥80% autonomous completion rate target
- Performance SLAs: ≤2s prep, ≤30s implement, ≤60s verify
- Real-time WebSocket events within ≤500ms
- Support for minimum 5 parallel customer executions
- Stop-on-error semantics for Phase 1 MVP
- Comprehensive security and audit requirements

### Status: MVP READY ✅
