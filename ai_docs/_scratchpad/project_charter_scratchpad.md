# DevTeam Runner Service - Project Charter Scratchpad

## Context Analysis
- **Frontend Charter**: DevTeam feature for Clarity CRM Frontend with autonomous task execution
- **Implementation Guide**: Backend service requirements for task automation
- **Existing Core Docs**: Music academy system (different project - need to replace)

## Key Requirements Extracted
- **Value Prop**: Local runner service for automated development task execution
- **Target Users**: Frontend developers using DevTeam interface
- **Primary Problem**: Manual task execution preventing continuous progression
- **Success Metrics**: ≥80% autonomous completion, ≤2s response times, parallel execution
- **Tech Stack**: Python/FastAPI, Docker, Git operations, AI tool integration
- **Constraints**: Phase 1 MVP with stop-on-error semantics

## Business Context
- **Frontend Feature**: Autonomous task execution engine for development workflows
- **Backend Service**: Local runner managing SELECT→PREP→IMPLEMENT→VERIFY pipeline
- **Integration**: WebSocket real-time updates, REST API endpoints
- **Deployment**: Docker containerized service

## Risks Identified
- AI tool integration complexity
- Git repository management
- WebSocket real-time communication
- Idempotency and error handling
- Security (input validation, output sanitization)

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Core Service (Week 1-2)
- Phase 2: Pipeline Implementation (Week 2-3) 
- Phase 3: Real-time & Polish (Week 3-4)
- Phase 4: Production Readiness (Week 4)
