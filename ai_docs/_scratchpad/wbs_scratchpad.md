# WBS Consultation Scratchpad

## Project Context
- Cedar Heights Music Academy backend system
- GenAI Launchpad workflow framework foundation
- FastAPI + Supabase + Stripe + Docker deployment
- Solo-preneur management focus
- 4-6 month MVP timeline

## Existing Infrastructure Analysis
- ✅ GenAI Launchpad workflow framework implemented
- ✅ Docker compose setup with Supabase integration
- ✅ Basic FastAPI structure
- ✅ Celery worker configuration
- ✅ Core workflow orchestration (TaskContext, Node system)
- ✅ Database migrations with Alembic
## Workflow Complexity Decisions ✅
- **Teacher Assignment**: Simple rule-based (first available for instrument)
- **Payment System**: Full Stripe subscription automation required (recurring lessons core to business)
- **Enrollment Flow**: Complete automation from signup to first lesson
- **Scheduling**: Basic lesson scheduling, defer optimization


## Key Requirements from Documents
- Workflow-driven business processes (enrollment, payment, scheduling)
- <200ms API response times for quick operations
- <2s workflow completion for complex operations
- Type safety with Pydantic validation
- Single-owner operator simplicity
- 99.9% uptime target
- 60% reduction in administrative overhead

## MVP Priority Clarification ✅
- **CRITICAL**: Payment processing workflow (Stripe integration)
- **CRITICAL**: Enrollment workflow (complete student onboarding)
- **DEFER**: Advanced scheduling optimization
- **DEFER**: AI-powered features
- **EXTERNAL SERVICES**: Already set up (Supabase, Stripe, email)

## Testing Strategy Decisions ✅
- **Approach**: Pragmatic - core workflow implementation with basic unit tests
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive including Stripe webhooks
- **Complex Scenarios**: Defer to Phase 2
- **Priority**: Get workflows working, then strengthen testing

## WBS Document Completed ✅
- **Comprehensive 16-week implementation plan created**
- **4 phases: Foundation → Core Workflows → Integration → Production**
- **48 detailed tasks with hour estimates (312 total hours)**
- **User stories, acceptance criteria, and dependencies defined**
- **Risk assessment and mitigation strategies included**
- **Testing strategy and success metrics established**

## Areas to Explore
- [x] MVP definition and feature releases
- [x] Testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
- [x] Work breakdown structure organization
- [x] User story development and prioritization
- [x] Sprint planning and task sequencing
- [x] CI/CD pipeline design
- [x] Risk mitigation strategies
- [x] Progress tracking approach

## Notes
- Need to balance workflow complexity with maintainability
- Must leverage existing GenAI Launchpad framework
- Focus on business value delivery over technical sophistication
- URGENT: Payment + Enrollment workflows are business critical
