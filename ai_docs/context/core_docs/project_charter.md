# DevTeam Runner Service - Project Charter
**MVP READY**

## Executive Summary

The DevTeam Runner Service is a critical backend microservice that enables autonomous development task execution for the Clarity CRM Frontend's DevTeam feature. This Python/FastAPI service orchestrates automated development workflows through a SELECT→PREP→IMPLEMENT→VERIFY pipeline, transforming manual task-by-task development into continuous, automated progression. The service manages Git repositories, executes AI-powered code implementation tools (Aider), and provides real-time progress updates via WebSocket connections.

**Primary Business Outcome**: Enable autonomous task execution with ≥80% completion rate without human intervention, supporting parallel customer project workflows while maintaining quality through automated verification and error resolution.

## Objectives (3)

1. **Autonomous Task Pipeline**: Implement SELECT→PREP→IMPLEMENT→VERIFY workflow with stop-on-error semantics for Phase 1 MVP
2. **Real-time Communication**: Provide WebSocket-based progress updates and execution logs with ≤500ms latency
3. **Multi-Customer Support**: Enable parallel task execution across multiple customer projects with proper resource isolation

## Success Metrics (3)

1. **Performance Targets**: ≤2s for /prep operations, ≤30s for /implement operations, ≤60s for /verify operations
2. **Autonomous Completion Rate**: ≥80% of atomic tasks completed end-to-end without human intervention
3. **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with comprehensive error handling and idempotent operations

## Stakeholders/Market

- **Primary Users**: Frontend developers using DevTeam interface for automated task execution
- **Secondary Users**: Project managers monitoring multiple customer project progress
- **Technical Stakeholders**: Backend development team, DevOps engineers
- **Business Stakeholders**: Clarity CRM product owners seeking development productivity gains

## Constraints

- **Technology Stack**: Python/FastAPI with Docker containerization (non-negotiable)
- **Phase 1 Scope**: Stop-on-error semantics, single Aider tool integration, basic task selection logic
- **Security Requirements**: Input validation, output sanitization, secure Git operations, audit logging
- **Integration Dependencies**: GitHub repository access, Aider tool availability, WebSocket infrastructure

## Top Risks and Mitigations

1. **Git Repository Management Complexity**
   - *Risk*: Repository cloning, branching, and merge conflicts
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive Git operation testing, conflict detection, rollback procedures

2. **AI Tool Integration Reliability**
   - *Risk*: Aider tool failures or inconsistent outputs
   - *Mitigation*: Robust error handling, tool output validation, fallback to manual processing

3. **WebSocket Connection Stability**
   - *Risk*: Real-time communication failures affecting user experience
   - *Mitigation*: Connection recovery mechanisms, exponential backoff, event throttling

## Timeline/Milestones

- **Week 1-2**: Core Service (Health check, /prep endpoint, repository management)
- **Week 2-3**: Pipeline Implementation (/implement, /verify, task selection logic)
- **Week 3-4**: Real-time & Polish (WebSocket implementation, comprehensive testing)
- **Week 4**: Production Readiness (Security hardening, documentation, deployment)

## Next Actions

- Set up Python/FastAPI development environment with Docker configuration
- Implement health check endpoint and basic repository preparation logic
- Create task selection algorithm for parsing tasks_list.md files
- Establish WebSocket server infrastructure for real-time communication
- Design comprehensive error handling and logging framework
