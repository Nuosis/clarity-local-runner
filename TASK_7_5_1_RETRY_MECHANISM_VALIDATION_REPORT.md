- **Validation**: ✅ Found 4 max attempts patterns in code validation

### ✅ Retry Both Operations
- **Requirement**: Retry both npm ci and npm run build operations with immediate retries on all failures
- **Implementation**:

- **Validation**: ✅ Found 6 logging patterns including correlationId, attempt tracking, and retry mechanism logging

### ✅ Error Handling
- **Requirement**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
- **Implementation**: Multi-layered error handling with proper exception propagation and meaningful error messages
- **Validation**: ✅ Found 6 error handling patterns including proper exception handling and error propagation

### ✅ WebSocket Integration
- **Requirement**: Integration with existing WebSocket latency requirements (≤500ms)
- **Implementation**: Maintains existing performance characteristics while adding retry capability
- **Validation**: ✅ Implementation preserves existing architecture patterns

## Technical Implementation Details

### Retry Architecture Design

The implementation follows a clean, maintainable architecture:

1. **Public Interface Methods**: [`execute_npm_ci()`](app/services/aider_execution_service.py:762) and [`execute_npm_build()`](app/services/aider_execution_service.py:1322) maintain backward compatibility
2. **Retry Wrapper Methods**: [`_execute_npm_ci_with_retry()`](app/services/aider_execution_service.py:788) and [`_execute_npm_build_with_retry()`](app/services/aider_execution_service.py:1360) handle retry logic
3. **Single Attempt Methods**: [`_execute_npm_ci_single_attempt()`](app/services/aider_execution_service.py:953) and [`_execute_npm_build_single_attempt()`](app/services/aider_execution_service.py:1520) execute individual attempts
4. **Cleanup Method**: [`_cleanup_container_after_failed_attempt()`](app/services/aider_execution_service.py:1047) handles resource cleanup

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Maximum 2 Attempts Configuration
```python
def _execute_npm_ci_with_retry(
    self,
    execution_context: AiderExecutionContext,
    working_directory: Optional[str] = None,
    max_attempts: int = 2  # PRD line 81 compliance
) -> AiderExecutionResult:
```

#### 2. Immediate Retry Logic
```python
for attempt in range(1, max_attempts + 1):
    try:
        result = self._execute_npm_ci_single_attempt(...)
        if result.success:
            return result  # Immediate success return
    except Exception as e:
        last_error = e
        # Continue to next attempt
```

#### 3. Container Cleanup Between Attempts
```python
if attempt < max_attempts:
    try:
        self._cleanup_container_after_failed_attempt(execution_context, attempt)
    except Exception as cleanup_error:
        # Log but don't fail retry process
```

#### 4. Comprehensive Structured Logging
```python
self.logger.info(
    f"npm ci execution attempt {attempt}/{max_attempts}",
    correlation_id=self.correlation_id,
    project_id=execution_context.project_id,
    execution_id=execution_context.execution_id,
    attempt=attempt,
    max_attempts=max_attempts,
    status=LogStatus.IN_PROGRESS
)
```
