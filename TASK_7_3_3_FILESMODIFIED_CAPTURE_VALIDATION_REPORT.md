## Technical Implementation Analysis

### Core Implementation: [`_capture_execution_artifacts()`](app/services/aider_execution_service.py:655)

The filesModified capture functionality is implemented within the comprehensive artifact capture method:

```python
def _capture_execution_artifacts(self, container, context: AiderExecutionContext, execution_result: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    artifacts = {
        'diff_output': None,
        'files_modified': [],  # ← FilesModified list initialization
        'commit_hash': None,
        'aider_version': None
    }
    
    # Extract files modified from stdout using regex patterns
    stdout = execution_result.get('stdout', '')
    files_modified = []
    
    for pattern in self.MODIFIED_FILES_PATTERNS:  # ← Pattern-based extraction
        matches = pattern.findall(stdout)
        files_modified.extend(matches)
    
    # Clean and deduplicate file paths
    artifacts['files_modified'] = list(set(  # ← Deduplication
        file.strip() for file in files_modified if file.strip()
    ))
```

### File Detection Patterns: [`MODIFIED_FILES_PATTERNS`](app/services/aider_execution_service.py:138)

```python
MODIFIED_FILES_PATTERNS = [
    re.compile(r'^\s*Modified\s+(.+)$', re.MULTILINE | re.IGNORECASE),  # ← Modified files
    re.compile(r'^\s*Created\s+(.+)$', re.MULTILINE | re.IGNORECASE),   # ← Created files
    re.compile(r'^\s*Deleted\s+(.+)$', re.MULTILINE | re.IGNORECASE),   # ← Deleted files
]
```

### Result Integration: [`AiderExecutionResult.files_modified`](app/services/aider_execution_service.py:81)

```python
@dataclass
class AiderExecutionResult:
    # ... other fields ...
    files_modified: Optional[List[str]] = None  # ← FilesModified field
    
    # Integration in execute_aider method:
    result.files_modified = artifacts.get('files_modified', [])  # ← Assignment
```
